# Guided User Behavior Review Experience

A frontend-focused web experience designed to **guide users through a controlled flow** while observing and reviewing how they interact with the interface.  
The project emphasizes **user behavior, engagement patterns, and experience-driven design** rather than traditional page navigation.

## ✨ Overview

This project was built to explore how user behavior changes when the interface controls pacing, scrolling, and interaction flow.  
Instead of allowing unrestricted navigation, the experience deliberately **guides users step-by-step**, enabling meaningful observation of how users respond to prompts, content, and interaction points.

The application functions as both a **demo experience** and a **behavior review system**, making it suitable for portfolios and product-thinking showcases.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- Guided user flow instead of free scrolling
- Interaction-based progression
- Observing engagement through user actions
- Experience-first UI design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – state-driven UI and component architecture  
- **CSS** – layout control, transitions, and visual hierarchy  
- **JavaScript** – flow logic, interaction tracking, and state management  

## 🎯 Key Features

- Controlled scrolling to manage pacing and attention
- Step-based flow for structured user journeys
- Interactive popups and prompts
- Review mode to evaluate user interaction behavior
- Modular architecture to extend flows and steps easily

## 🧪 What This Project Explores

- How users behave in **guided vs free navigation**
- How interaction timing affects engagement
- How UI constraints can improve clarity and focus
- Designing interfaces with **intentional friction**

## 📚 What I Learned

- Thinking in terms of **user journeys**, not screens
- Designing UI flows that communicate intent clearly
- Balancing control with usability
- Building systems that support observation and iteration

## 🚀 Possible Enhancements

- Analytics-based behavior visualization
- Session-based interaction summaries
- Adaptive flows based on user behavior
- Expanded review logic for deeper insights

## 📄 Note

This project was built as an exploration of **experience-led frontend development**, focusing on how users interact, react, and progress through intentionally designed UI flows.
